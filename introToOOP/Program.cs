            //...each instance can have its own unique values.

            // the format we use to instantiate an object looks like this:
            //ClassName objectName = new ClassName();
            Cat mittens = new Cat();
            //to create new object we use special method called constructor

            //..three examples of objects. your objects should have five states and five behaviors
            //
